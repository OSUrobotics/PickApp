## Description
This package takes datasets of apple picks performed with a robotic manipulator UR5e and a robotic gripper as end effector.
The picks are performed in a real tree and in an apple proxy that emulates the physics of the apple tree.
Hence, this package is useful for the user to:
i) Compare time-series plots from real and proxy picks
ii) Obtain statistics about the experiments, such as the distribution of cartesian and angular noise
iii) Do basic machine learning to check if - with the given data - it is possible to train a classifier and predict the outcome of the pick (e.g. successful, failed)
